                <h2>Origin Story</h2>
                <p>
                    Alice and Willetta were both feral kittens born at seperate ends of Multnomah county.
                    Willetta was found attempting to break into someone's house during a thunderstorm.
                    Alice led a peaceful life in someone's barn. Fate brought them together at a no-kill 
                    shelter where the unlikely duo bonded. They were adopted as a pair by a couple of 
                    weirdos in NE Portland.

                <h2>Habits</h2>
                <p>
            Alice and Willetta both enjoy:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>running through the house</li>
                <li>chewing on silvervine sticks</li>
                <li>yowling loudly every night at the same time for treats</li>        
            </ol> 
            <p>Compared to Willetta, Alice is
            shy and quiet. She can usually be found hiding under the couch. On the other hand, Willetta
            assumes all other living things are for her entertainment, and will aggressively remind such
            beings of this fact. Willetta's favorite activity is waking her humans up at 6 a.m. demanding
            attention.

                <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
                <ul>
                <li>
                    Alice has a clipped ear. We think this means she was caught and spayed and then released when she was a kitten.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Willetta has a digestive abnormality which makes it so she can only eat certain foods. Normal cat food causes terrifying problems that are difficult to clean up afterward ðŸ˜’
                </li>
                <li>
                    Alice curls her back feet when she yawns (not really a fun fact, just adorable.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Willetta was taken away from her mother too early as a kitten, and now she thinks her humans flesh are a good source of milk ðŸ˜¬
